This project consists of the source files for the men's choir musik that appears in MP3 and MIDI form at 
<http://www.mcfm.ch/musik>

The .mus files were created in Finale Notepad and Finale SongWriter:

<http://www.finalemusic.com/products/finale-songwriter/>
The .musx files were created in Finale PrintMusic:
<http://www.finalemusic.com/products/finale-printmusic/>

The .mscz files were created in MuseScore 0.9.6.2:

Some of the earlier MIDI files on <http://www.mcfm.ch/> were created direct from the music editors referenced above - in some 
cases via GNMIDI:
<http://www.gnmidi.com/>.
Some of the earlier MP3 files on <http://www.mcfm.ch/> were created from the MIDI files using Switch Sound File Converter:
<http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html>

Later MIDI and MP3 files were created directly in the Finale SongWriter and PrintMusic tools mentioned above.

This repository of music source files was previously hosted by Google Code. It was automatically exported from 
<https://code.google.com/p/mcfm-musik/> on 2015-09-03.
